# last-man-standing

Full stack web application to facilitate my family's Premier League prediction game. 

Built using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Usage

Click 'Make an Entry' to create a new entry in the database for the gameweek. You will be taken to a page listing all current entries.

Click 'View Entries' if you've already got an entry for this gameweek and want to see the others. 

Database will be reset somewhere near the start of each gameweek, yell at me if I forget.
